## Code of conduct

We will be abiding by a code of conduct for this workshop based on the code of [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/). 

Please respect fellow learners, instructors, and helpers. 

## Surveys

Please be sure to complete these surveys before and after the workshop. It is okay if you know nothing about R as you answer these - introducing you to R is the point of this workshop series!

## Schedule

### Workshop 1: Why R?

In this workshop, we will walk through an overview of R and why it is so useful for ecologists. During this workshop, the instructors will ensure that everyone has successfully downloaded R and RStudio and completed the setup tasks outlined [below](#setup). 

### Workshop 2: [Getting Started in R and RStudio](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/introduction-r-rstudio.html)

In this workshop, we will get oriented to R and RStudio and how they work together. We will also talk about file and folder organization that will generally be helful for project management, but make it much easier to work with R programming on your computer. We will also quickly review why ecologists use R for data analysis.

### Workshop 3: [Data Visualization with `ggplot2`](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/visualizing-ggplot.html)

In this workshop, we will learn how to visualize data in R and RStudio using a package called `ggplot2`

### Workshop 4: [Exploring and Understanding Data](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/how-r-thinks-about-data.html)

In this workshop, we will dive a bit deeper into R and learn how R stores data and how different ways that R stores data can help ecologists working with R.

### Workshop 5: [Working with Data](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/working-with-data.html)

In this workshop, we will learn how to import data into R and make these data easier to use for analysis and visualization.

### Workshop 6: Working with Data, Part 2

In this workshop session, participants will be working to import their own datasets into R. We will  process and visualize data together during the session and instructors will be available to troubleshoot issues with data in R.

### Workshop 7: [Introduction to Statistics in R](https://anamtk.github.io/stats_workshop/Introduction_to_Statistics.html)

In this workshop, we will learn about how to run statistical tests in R. These will match statistical tests participants will already know how to do in the program JMP from earlier in the RaMP training. 

### Workshop 8: Wrap up

In this workshop, we will wrap up with any final questions that participants have about using R.

## Setup

Before the workshop, please make sure you have completed the following setup steps: 

### Download/Update R and RStudio

You will need a current version of R and RStudio for this workshop. You can find [instructions for installing or updating these programs here](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/index.html).

You are only required to follow the instructions under the **Install R and RStudio** or **Update R and RStudio** sections. We will go over the remainder together during workshop #1. 

### Bring your own dataset(s) to Workshop #6

Please bring one or more datasets you hope to incoroprate into your own research for Workshop #6. We will be using the tools we've learned in importing and cleaning data in R as well as visualizing data in R with datasets you have collected during your RaMP training. Instructors will be available to answer questions and help troubleshoot solutions. We will be working together to try common data import and cleaning steps. This is a great time to troubleshoot errors too because it's likely that more than one person will see the same error and the instructors will be available to walk through these issues.
